          "description": "The Castle of Otranto, with all its peculiarites, must be allowed to be a much more interesting and animated composition than the Count of Narbonne; and had the author of the Gothic Story chosen to have given his work a direct dramatic form, he would most probably have exhibited a performance very different from the tragedy before us. His magic might perhaps have appeared, in spectacle, at the theatre; or, at least, he who hazarded a ludicrous simplicity, in the deportment of the domestics, would not like his theatrical follower, have allotted to all his personages a sameness of language and character. Certain it is, that a coldness and obscurity pervades the present scenes, from a perpetual, but indistinct reference to a work which, entertaining as it is, hath not perhaps been read by the million, and is not, even by those who have read it, sufficiently remembered, to enable them to maintain the thread of the action in the representation. Fables may be borrowed; but borrowed or original, the drama should unfold itself, independent of all foreign matter. The Count of Narbonne, on the contrary, requires a constant commentary from the Castle of Otranto. The very opening is perplexed and obscure. The death of the son, and the flight of Isabel, are so blended, that neither are interesting, or indeed intelligible. Godfrey's challenge too is opened rather darkly. The appearance of the herald might have given it action, and have spared a cold narration, together with the heavy personage of Fabian, who is made a dull and unmov'd hearer and retailer of the story, to infintrate the plot into boxes. In many other particulars the fable is unsuccesfully traced from the novel, which almost every where rises superior, much superior, to the drama! and in no instance more eminently than in the delineation and conduct of the two female characters, Isabel and Matilda, which are sustained by the honourable novelist with the most delicate address, so managed as to render each of them respectively amiable, as well as to add much force and interest to the situation of Theodore, who appears in the Tragedy a mere drawing after Dorilas, and Douglas. On the whole, the fable of the Count of Narbonne is, in our opinion, maimed and defective. It is cold and obscure. All the leading incidents, instead of coming forth in dramatic action, are lost in narration, and touch not the passions.",

Such a traitor was John Paul Jones, especially dangerous to the British navy because of his skill in navigating the northern coast of Britain and steering clear of the hidden sand bars and rocky reefs and shoals. That hazardous coast is the setting for James Fennimore Cooper’s novel, The Pilot, a tale of John Paul Jones confronting storms and battling British ships.",

Then came William Bayle Bernard’s The Pilot: A Tale of the Sea (Coburg Theatre, 17 July 1826), and third T. J. Dibdin’s Paul Jones; or, The Solway Mariner (Adelphi Theatre, 12 February 1827)",

In playing the part of the Pilot, Terry conveyed a mental turmoil of doubts in portraying the character of a Scots seaman who had shifted his allegiances to the American navy. In spite of the charge that melodrama tended to oversimplify the nature of good and evil, Fitzball skillfully invested John Paul Jones with a convincing “tragic flaw.” As the Pilot in Fitzball’s adaptation, Terry could not expect shouts of approval, but he could hope to garner for the character a degree of sympathy and understanding. In spite of a prevailing British nationalism, the audience cheered the coxswain of the American schooner, Long Tom Coffin, played by Cooke.",
