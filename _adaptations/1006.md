general_notes: 'First performed in Covent Garden, in 1797. The first 15 playbills
  reference that the play is an adaptation; beginning with the 16th playbill (on April
  27, 1797), the adaptation claim is removed. In 1804, renamed from ''Raymond and
  Agnes; or, The Castle of Lindenbergh'' to ''Raymond and Agnes; or, The Bleeding
  Nun'' on Nov. 10, 1804. See playbill file: lsidyv3fa2b940_1804-1806_Covent_Garden_Playbills_0038'
adap_notes:
- note: Farley's Raymond and Agnes provided a model for later adaptations of Lewis's
    romance, most of which focused on the story of Don Raymond at the expense of that
    of Ambrosio

- note: In order to shape the Episode of Raymond and Agnes, from the romance of the
    Monk, for dramatic effect, the situation in which the Countess (step-mother of
    Agnes) is placed in the cottage, according to the romance, is now occupied by
    Agnes. Another variation occurs in making the Nun, whose Spectre appears, the
    mother of Agnes, and former Countess of Lindenbergh
