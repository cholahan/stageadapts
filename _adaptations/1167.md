adap_notes:
- note: While the revolution of the American Colonies was past, it was not forgotten.
    The Colonists who had renounced their loyalty to Britain were traitors; all the
    more traitorous were those who left Britain at the beginning of the war to join
    the Americans. Such a traitor was John Paul Jones, especially dangerous to the
    British navy because of his skill in navigating the northern coast of Britain
    and steering clear of the hidden sand bars and rocky reefs and shoals. That hazardous
    coast is the setting for James Fennimore Cooper’s novel, The Pilot, a tale of
    John Paul Jones confronting storms and battling British ships.

- note: 'Fitzball’s adaptation, The Pilot; or A Tale of the Sea (Adelphi Theatre,
    1825), met with two rival productions. Unlike the competition T. J. Dibdin encountered
    with The Pirate, rival versions of The Pilot appeared only in successive seasons.
    Fitzball’s version (Adelphi Theatre, 31 October 1825) was the first of the three
    adaptations of Cooper’s novel. Then came William Bayle Bernard’s The Pilot: A
    Tale of the Sea (Coburg Theatre, 17 July 1826), and third T. J. Dibdin’s Paul
    Jones; or, The Solway Mariner (Adelphi Theatre, 12 February 1827)'
  source: Frederick Burwick, Review, 'British Nautical Melodramas, 1820-1850' (2020)
- note: "[...]the most sympathetic portrayal of the misguided turncoat was Daniel
    Terry in the title role of Fitzball’s The Pilot. In playing the part of the Pilot,
    Terry conveyed a mental turmoil of doubts in portraying the character of a Scots
    seaman who had shifted his allegiances to the American navy. In spite of the charge
    that melodrama tended to oversimplify the nature of good and evil, Fitzball skillfully
    invested John Paul Jones with a convincing “tragic flaw.” As the Pilot in Fitzball’s
    adaptation, Terry could not expect shouts of approval, but he could hope to garner
    for the character a degree of sympathy and understanding. In spite of a prevailing
    British nationalism, the audience cheered the coxswain of the American schooner,
    Long Tom Coffin, played by Cooke."
