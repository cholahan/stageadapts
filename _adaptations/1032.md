adap_notes:
- note: The characters, language, and sentiment, are well drawn and supported, and
    sufficiently discriminated from each other. It has been thought, however, that
    the catastrophe is too shocking.

  description_review:
  - description: The Castle of Otranto, with all its peculiarites, must be allowed
      to be a much more interesting and animated composition than the Count of Narbonne;
      and had the author of the Gothic Story chosen to have given his work a direct
      dramatic form, he would most probably have exhibited a performance very different
      from the tragedy before us. His magic might perhaps have appeared, in spectacle,
      at the theatre; or, at least, he who hazarded a ludicrous simplicity, in the
      deportment of the domestics, would not like his theatrical follower, have allotted
      to all his personages a sameness of language and character. Certain it is, that
      a coldness and obscurity pervades the present scenes, from a perpetual, but
      indistinct reference to a work which, entertaining as it is, hath not perhaps
      been read by the million, and is not, even by those who have read it, sufficiently
      remembered, to enable them to maintain the thread of the action in the representation.
      Fables may be borrowed; but borrowed or original, the drama should unfold itself,
      independent of all foreign matter. The Count of Narbonne, on the contrary, requires
      a constant commentary from the Castle of Otranto. The very opening is perplexed
      and obscure. The death of the son, and the flight of Isabel, are so blended,
      that neither are interesting, or indeed intelligible. Godfrey's challenge too
      is opened rather darkly. The appearance of the herald might have given it action,
      and have spared a cold narration, together with the heavy personage of Fabian,
      who is made a dull and unmov'd hearer and retailer of the story, to infintrate
      the plot into boxes. In many other particulars the fable is unsuccesfully traced
      from the novel, which almost every where rises superior, much superior, to the
      drama! and in no instance more eminently than in the delineation and conduct
      of the two female characters, Isabel and Matilda, which are sustained by the
      honourable novelist with the most delicate address, so managed as to render
      each of them respectively amiable, as well as to add much force and interest
      to the situation of Theodore, who appears in the Tragedy a mere drawing after
      Dorilas, and Douglas. On the whole, the fable of the Count of Narbonne is, in
      our opinion, maimed and defective. It is cold and obscure. All the leading incidents,
      instead of coming forth in dramatic action, are lost in narration, and touch
      not the passions.
