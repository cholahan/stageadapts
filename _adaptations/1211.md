adap_notes:
- note: 'In Fitzball''s Paul Clifford, political conflict is transpoed into the private
    sphere of romantic love. Moreover, Fitzball rejects Bulwer-Lytton''s sociological
    analysis of criminality, and emphasises Clifford''s responsibility for his crimes
    Whereas, at the end of the novel Paul abandons England for the new, hopeful land
    of America, Fitzball depicts his hero departing on a patriotic mission to aid
    the Queen of Hungary. Here, the reintegration of Clifford into British society
    also sidesteps Bulwer-Lytton''s biting social criticims: Fitzball''s adaptation
    disolves the critique at the heart of this Newgate novel'

  description_review:
  - description: The truth is, that when at the Surrey, Osbaldiston won the hearts
      of all the pickpockets, by the amiable light in which he placed all criminals
      in his pieces, from the wholesale cut throat to the retailer of pocket handkerchiefts;
      and the whole fraternity of thieves have stuck to him, and will stick to him,
      so long as he is in management. It is, of course, in compliment to this class,
      that 'Paul Clifford' has been produced; and in fact, the whole series of Fitzball's
      dramatic effusions are intended as literary offerings to the thieves of the
      metropolis.
