adap_notes:
- note: The original machinery has been rejected, because it would have been too daring
    an attempt to interweave it with the fable of a modern composition, and perhaps
    too mighty a task to manage without violating the first great law of dramatick
    probability. At the same time, it has been the author's most assiduous endeavour,
    to 'convert the sententious display of eastern wisdom, as far as character would
    permit, into the language of passion, varied by every motive which might most
    forcibly affect the human mind in the most warm and intersting situations.' These
    are the words of a critick, who seems fully to have penetrated the design of the
    author.
  source: Preface to printed work
- note: The fable and characters of this play are copied from Dr Hawkesworth's well-known
    tale of Almoran and Hamet; and they are copied with more exactness than is usual
    in the composition of a play. We mean not this as the slightest objection; as
    the art of giving life to the descriptions of a tale, is often much greater than
    that of contriving the tale itself.

- note: "[...] like its source, it makes shape-shifting integral to its action."
  source: James Watt, British Orientalisms (2019), pp. 107
- note: Pratt's work begins by outlining the recent division of the Persian throne
    between the brothers Almoran and Hamet after the death of their father, and in
    thus alluding to the ongoing American war the play conceives of Persia as a 'parallel
    universe' rather than as a place to be 'acted upon' by Europeans.

  description_review:
  - description: The incidents are well managed, and the interest and pathos are judiciously
      graduated, until poetic justice takes place in the death of Almoran, and the
      union of Hamet with the Fair Circassian. But the play would not suffer if almost
      every scene were pruned. The forte of the author is sentiment; and every occasion
      is studiously seized to say a pointed thing, or strew a beautiful flower. These
      are venial, because they are captivating faults; but they may denominate the
      piece of Sentimental Tragedy
