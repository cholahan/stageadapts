adap_notes:
- note: An anti-slavery piece, presenting the European slave traders as ridiculous
    characters.
  source: Huntington Library catalogue
- note: The play was performed, in part, to celebrate Parliament’s move to end the
    trade in 1807, and there are certainly anti-slavery sentiments expressed – note,
    for example, the names of the slavers, Fetterwell, Marrowbone, Grim, and Flayall
    – but the title, nevertheless, hides slavery under another term, 'war.'
  source: Dana Van Kooy and Jeffrey N. Cox, 'Melodramatic Slaves' (2012)
- note: The characters of Mug and Sutta, however, bear too near a resemblance to the
    Trudge and Woski of the author in his Inkle and Yarico
