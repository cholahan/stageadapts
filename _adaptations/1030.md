adap_notes:
- note: This interesting Play is taken from Madame Cottin's celebrated French work,
    Elizabeth, or the Exile of Siberia. The story’s sentiments, and most striking
    situations, are closely copied from the original, which has been universally read
    and admired through Europe, and translated into almost every modern language.
    Were the narrative merely the creation of fancy, it would be considered as affecting
    a fiction as ever met the public eye; but as.it is generally known to be founded
    on truth, and to be actually an established fact, tenfold sympathy is naturally
    excited by its grand representation. The Heroine of this piece was a character
    that really existed in our own times, who undertook a dangerous and painful journey
    of several thousand miles, over trackless snows and inhospitable, deserts, to
    throw herself at the feet of her sovereign at his coronation, and implore pardon
    for an honourable, but exiled father. The Emperor Alexander, whose magnanimity
    has since been the theme of every tongue, even then gave a happy and glorious
    presage of his character and reign, by generously granting a parent's freedom
    to the ardent supplications of his duteous child, thus rewarding filial piety,
    and exerting the best prerogative of royalty,--the power of pardon. This transaction,
    so honourable to that monarcb, from motives of stage effect and propriety, is
    fixed at a remote period of history. Facts are improved by the most impressive
    fictions. The heroic character of Daran, the unwearied champion and protector
    of oppressed innocence, heightens the serious interest of the piece, while the
    pathetic is admirably blended with the comic, and the most animated and choice
    music sheds brilliance over the whole of this varied and entertaining Drama.
