  London_Stage: Rich's Company. The date of the premiere is not known, but the fact
    that the play was advertised in the Post Boy, 12-14 Dec. 1695, and the London
    Gazette, No. 3140, 12-16 Dec. 1695, suggests that it was probably first acted
    not later than November 1695
  Drama_data_notes: According to Bolton, it was performed most repeatedly in the 1730s
    and 1740s. Continued to be performed during and after Hawkesworth's version. In
    the 1770s and 1780s again became to the most performed version.
