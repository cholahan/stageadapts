      <br><b>Adaptation Notes</b><br>
      
        <ul><li>Farley's Raymond and Agnes provided a model for later adaptations of Lewis's romance, most of which focused on the story of Don Raymond at the expense of that of Ambrosio

        </li></ul>
      
        <ul><li>In order to shape the Episode of Raymond and Agnes, from the romance of the Monk, for dramatic effect, the situation in which the Countess (step-mother of Agnes) is placed in the cottage, according to the romance, is now occupied by Agnes. Another variation occurs in making the Nun, whose Spectre appears, the mother of Agnes, and former Countess of Lindenbergh
