      <br><b>Adaptation Notes</b><br>
      
        <ul><li>This interesting Play is taken from Madame Cottin's celebrated French work, Elizabeth, or the Exile of Siberia. The story’s sentiments, and most striking situations, are closely copied from the original, which has been universally read and admired through Europe, and translated into almost every modern language. Were the narrative merely the creation of fancy, it would be considered as affecting a fiction as ever met the public eye; but as.it is generally known to be founded on truth, and to be actually an established fact, tenfold sympathy is naturally excited by its grand representation. The Heroine of this piece was a character that really existed in our own times, who undertook a dangerous and painful journey of several thousand miles, over trackless snows and inhospitable, deserts, to throw herself at the feet of her sovereign at his coronation, and implore pardon for an honourable, but exiled father. The Emperor Alexander, whose magnanimity has since been the theme of every tongue, even then gave a happy and glorious presage of his character and reign, by generously granting a parent's freedom to the ardent supplications of his duteous child, thus rewarding filial piety, and exerting the best prerogative of royalty,--the power of pardon. This transaction, so honourable to that monarcb, from motives of stage effect and propriety, is fixed at a remote period of history. Facts are improved by the most impressive fictions. The heroic character of Daran, the unwearied champion and protector of oppressed innocence, heightens the serious interest of the piece, while the pathetic is admirably blended with the comic, and the most animated and choice music sheds brilliance over the whole of this varied and entertaining Drama.
