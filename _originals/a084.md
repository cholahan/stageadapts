notes: 'Review in The Monthly Mirror, April 1800: ''Although no novelty, such is the
  strong interest attached to the Romance of ''The Black Castle, or the Spirit of
  Ravia,'' excited by the exquisite acting of Young Astley and Miss Smith, that crowded
  houses sufficiently testify the manager would be an enemy to himself were he to
  lay it aside.'''
