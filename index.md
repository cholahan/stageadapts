__Novel(ty) on Stage__ is an ongoing database project that records and details all dramatic adaptations of non-dramatic texts from 1660-1843: including dramatic adaptations of novels, short stories, and poetry. The database also includes stage productions that have been adapted into non-dramatic prose forms, including novels and novellas.

This site and the database are currently _in-progress_. Learn more about the project [here](/stageadapts/project).

The database currently contains records for 197 adaptations and 108 originals. This site only currently holds a small sample of those records. Learn more about the database [here](/stageadapts/database/).
