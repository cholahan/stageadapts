_Novel(ty) on Stage_ is a database project created by <a href="http://www.cassidyholahan.com/" target="_blank">Cassidy Holahan</a>.

This project was created by support from the <a href="https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">Price Lab for Digital Humanities</a> at the University of Pennsylvania during a Mellon Mid-Doctoral Fellowship from 2020-21. 

This site was created using <a href="https://minicomp.github.io/wax/" target="_blank">Wax</a>, a minimal computing project for creating digital exhibitions. Wax is currently maintained by Marii Nyr√∂p at New York University and <a href="https://github.com/elotroalex" target="_blank">Alex Gil</a> at Columbia University Libraries. It uses open source libraries and frameworks including [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [OpenSeaDragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), and [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/).
