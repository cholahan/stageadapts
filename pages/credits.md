_Novel(ty) on Stage_ is a database project created by [Cassidy Holahan](https://www.cassidyholahan.com).

This project was created by support from the [Price Lab for Digital Humanities](https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania during a Mellon Mid-Doctoral Fellowship from 2020-21. 

This site was created using [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/), a minimal computing project for creating digital exhibitions. Wax is currently maintained by Marii Nyr√∂p at New York University and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex) at Columbia University Libraries. It uses open source libraries and frameworks including [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [OpenSeaDragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), and [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/).
