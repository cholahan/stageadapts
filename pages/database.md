The database records cases of adaptation of non-dramatic liteary texts to the stage, and all adaptations of plays to non-dramatic prose forms during the long eighteenth century.

The database strives to account for all adaptations between 1660-1843: beginning with the Restoration and ending with the passage of the Theatres Act of 1834.

The goal of this project grew out of an interest in the relationship between the novel and the stage, though the database has since grown to encompass other liteary forms, including short stories, novellas, fictional pieces printed in periodicals, and poetry. 

Each database record contains information within 82 possible fields, including a subset of information on the performance history and print publicaiton history, when applicable. Some records include descriptions of the adaptation given in theatre reviews, book reviews, or playbills. See the record on Frederick Reynold's [The Exile; or, The Deserts of Siberia](/wax/adaptations/1030/) for a glimpse into the rich information contained within the database. 

The database also includes a record for each [original](/wax/originals/) off of which an adaptation is based on.

This site site currently only represents a small sample from the database, though it will eventually hold all records. In the second phase of the project, the database will also be released as individual JSON records for large-scale analysis. [Browse a sample of the database here.](/wax/collection/)
