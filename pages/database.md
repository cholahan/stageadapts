The __database__ records cases of adaptation of non-dramatic liteary texts to the stage, and all adaptations of plays to non-dramatic prose forms. The goal of this project grew out of an interest in the relationship between the novel and the stage, though the database has since grown to encompass other liteary forms, including short stories, novellas, fictional pieces printed in periodicals, and poetry. 

The database attempts to account for all adaptations possible between 1660-1843: beginning with the Restoration and ending with the passage of the Theatres Act of 1834.

This site site currently only represents a small sample from the database, though it will eventually hold all records. In the second phase of the project, the database will also be released as individual JSON records for large-scale analysis.
