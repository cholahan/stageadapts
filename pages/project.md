_Novel(ty) on Stage_ is an ongoing database project that attempts to record and detail all dramatic adaptations of non-dramatic texts, and all adaptations of dramatic works into non-dramatic prose forms, from 1660-1843: including dramatic adaptations of novels, short stories, and poetry, and novelistic adaptations of stage productions. Learn more about the selection criteria for the database [here](/wax/database/).
